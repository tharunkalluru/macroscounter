# MacroDesi — Build Progress

Tracks phase-by-phase execution against `dev-plan-ai-agent.md`.

## Phase 0 — Scaffold & CI Harness
- Status: **PASS**
- Built: Vite + React 18 + TS project; Tailwind CSS; `vite-plugin-pwa` (manifest + service worker,
  `generateSW`/`autoUpdate`); ESLint (flat-free `.eslintrc.cjs`, `@typescript-eslint`,
  `react-hooks`) + Prettier; Vitest + React Testing Library; Playwright against `vite preview`
  (port 4173); app shell renders "MacroDesi"; `PROGRESS.md` / `BLOCKED.md` templates; git repo
  initialized.
- Tests: 1 unit (App shell smoke), 3 E2E (page loads, manifest present & valid, service worker
  registers on preview build).
- Gate: `npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run test -- --run && npm run build && npm run test:e2e`
  → **all green**.
- Notes: pinned React 18.3 / Vite 5 / ESLint 8 (not the create-vite defaults of React 19 / Vite 8 /
  oxlint) to match the fixed tech stack in the dev plan. PWA icon is a single SVG (`purpose: any` +
  `maskable`) rather than generated PNG raster set — sufficient for manifest validity; can be
  swapped for real app art later without code changes.

## Phase 1 — Food Database & Data Layer
- Status: **PASS**
- Built: `scripts/build-fooddb.ts` generates `public/fooddb.json` from a hand-curated dataset
  (`scripts/data/curatedFoods.ts`, **307 foods** — South Indian staples, chicken/fish/mutton/egg
  dishes, dals, vegetable curries, breads, snacks, sweets, beverages, dairy, fruits, nuts, and
  general/fitness basics), each with household portions, aliases, and per-100g macros. `kcal` is
  *derived* from `p/c/f` via Atwater factors (4/4/9) at build time (1-decimal precision) so every
  entry is exactly internally consistent — sidesteps the integer-rounding edge case that broke the
  15%-tolerance check on near-zero-kcal items like Black Tea. Dexie v1 schema
  ([db.ts](src/data/db.ts)) with all 8 tables from the spec (`profiles`, `targets`, `foods`,
  `recipes`, `logEntries`, `weighIns`, `scannedProducts`, `mealTemplates`) locked in now so later
  phases only ever *add* `.version()` blocks, never edit this one. Typed repos: `FoodRepo`,
  `LogRepo`. Fuse.js `FoodSearchService` (name/alias weighted, typo-tolerant).
  `npm run build:fooddb` wired as a `pretest`/`prebuild`/`prevalidate:fooddb` hook so the JSON is
  always regenerated fresh, and the generated file is also committed for `npm run dev`.
- Tests: 8 DB-integrity tests (count ≥300, kcal>0, macro consistency, ≥1 portion, positive grams,
  unique ids/names, category+source present) over the generated JSON; 19 search tests (alias
  matches, typo tolerance incl. multi-word "chiken biryani", empty query, and all 15 named
  top-result relevance assertions — passed without threshold tuning); 10 repo CRUD round-trip
  tests (`FoodRepo`, `LogRepo`) against `fake-indexeddb`. 38 unit tests total, all passing.
- Gate: standard block + `npm run validate:fooddb` → **all green**.
- Notes: nutrition values are plausible curated approximations "in the spirit of" IFCT-2017/INDB
  patterns, not a verbatim dataset export (no network/licensed-data access in this environment) —
  documented as such in the source file's header comment.

## Phase 2 — Onboarding & Goal Engine
- Status: **PASS**
- Built: [goalEngine.ts](src/domain/goals/goalEngine.ts) — Mifflin-St Jeor BMR → TDEE via activity
  multiplier → cut target = TDEE−500 floored at `max(BMR, 1500♂/1200♀)`, maintain = TDEE, gain =
  TDEE+300; protein 1.8 g/kg default (clamped 1.6–2.2), fat 0.7 g/kg floor, carbs = remainder.
  Single-page onboarding form ([OnboardingFlow.tsx](src/app/OnboardingFlow.tsx)) collecting
  name/sex/age/height/weight/activity/goal (goal defaults to "Lose fat" = cut); computes + persists
  Profile and an initial Targets row (`effectiveDate` = today, `source: 'computed'`). Minimal
  Dashboard showing the day's kcal/protein/carb/fat targets (ring/bars land in Phase 3). Settings
  page re-uses the same form to edit the profile and recompute targets. `ProfileRepo` (single-row
  upsert) and `TargetRepo` (`getLatest`/`getAll` by `effectiveDate`) added to the Phase 1 repo
  layer. App root redirects to `/onboarding` when no profile exists yet.
- Bug caught by the property test, fixed in code (not the test): `0.7 * 85` evaluates to
  `59.49999999999999` in IEEE754, which made `Math.round` truncate down to a mathematically wrong
  half-up result. Added a `round()` helper in `goalEngine.ts` that clears float noise via
  `toFixed(6)` before rounding — same fix needed anywhere grams-per-kg get multiplied out.
- Tests: 12 goal-engine unit tests — 7 hand-computed fixture personas (BMR-floor-binding sedentary
  male, no-floor very-active female, absolute-1200-floor low-bodyweight female, absolute-1500-floor
  low-bodyweight male, sedentary-vs-very_active pair, gain, maintain), 4 editable-range/floor
  clamp tests, 1 property test (500 seeded-random profiles asserting macro-kcal sum within ±2% of
  target and protein/fat never below floors). 6 new repo CRUD tests (`ProfileRepo`, `TargetRepo`).
  2 E2E tests: full onboarding journey for the "male/sedentary/cut" fixture persona asserting the
  dashboard shows the exact fixture numbers (1628 kcal / 126p / 171c / 49f, matching the unit-test
  fixture to the gram), and a reload-persistence check. 56 unit tests + 5 E2E total, all passing.
- Gate: standard block → **all green**.
